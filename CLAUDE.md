# CLAUDE.md — QC Estimator

## Project Overview
QC Estimator is an internal pricing tool for QC Event Design, a corporate event planning company based in Lake Wylie, SC. It replaces a 30+ tab Excel workbook with a web application that centralizes reference data (tax rates, category markups, travel costs, commission rules) and provides a clean UI for building multi-scenario venue estimates with automated pricing calculations, margin analysis, and export for Canva proposals.

**Owner:** Gary Stack (Stack Industries LLC)
**End Users:** QC Event Design team (3-5 non-technical event planners)
**Stack:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS), Tailwind CSS, Vercel
**Status:** Phase 1 — In Development

## Critical Business Logic

### Pricing Engine (src/lib/engine/)
This is the heart of the application. The pricing engine must produce IDENTICAL results to the Excel workbook for the same inputs. Any deviation will cause the team to lose trust and revert to Excel.

**Core formula:** `clientCost = ourCost × (1 + categoryMarkup%)`

**Category markups (11 categories):**
- Catering & F&B: 55%
- Venues & Room Rentals: 60%
- AV & Production: 65%
- Décor & Design: 85%
- Entertainment: 75%
- Activities & Experiences: 75%
- Transportation: 75%
- Staffing & Labor: 90%
- Purchased / Sourced Items: 200%
- Delivery & Logistics: 85%
- Tours & Guided Experiences: 65%
- Absolute floor: 50% (no exceptions without owner approval)

**Tax model:** Three separate tax rates per location (food, alcohol, general sales). 22 locations in the initial dataset, all at the county/city level. Tax rates are applied per line item based on the item's tax type.

**Restaurant fee structure (Venue estimates only):**
- Service Charge: 20% or 21.5% or None (applied to F&B subtotal)
- Gratuity: 20% or None (applied to F&B subtotal)
- Admin Fee: 5% or None (applied to F&B subtotal)
- Defaults set at program level, overridable per venue

**Commission layers:**
- CC Processing Fee: 3.5% on subtotal
- Client Commission: 5% default (variable, sometimes 0%)
- GDP Commission: 6.5% toggle (Yes/No, rate never changes)
- Third-party commissions: variable, added per-program

**Production Fee formula:**
`productionFee = subtotal × ccProcessingRate + markupRevenue × clientCommission`

**Margin health thresholds:**
- QC Margin: ≥35% Strong, ≥28% On Target, ≥22% Review, <22% Below Floor
- True Net (after hours + travel): ≥15% Strong, ≥7% On Target, ≥0% Thin, <0% Losing Money

**Team hours:** Looked up from a 14-tier revenue table, multiplied by $90/hr for OpEx estimate.

### Key Rule: The pricing engine MUST be framework-agnostic TypeScript in src/lib/engine/. No React, no Next.js, no Supabase imports. Pure functions that take inputs and return calculated results. This makes it testable and portable.

## Session Protocol

### Starting a Session
1. Read this CLAUDE.md
2. Check PRD.md for current phase and status
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Check for any failing tests before making changes
5. Ask Gary what we're working on today

### During a Session
- Run tests after every significant change
- Commit after each completed feature or fix
- Update the Design Decisions Log for non-obvious choices
- Never modify the pricing engine without adding or updating tests first

### Ending a Session
1. Run full test suite: `npm test`
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Update the Current TODOs section below
4. Update PRD.md phase status if applicable
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Summarize what was done and what's next

## Communication Preferences
- Direct and honest — no filler, no enthusiasm
- If something is wrong with the approach, say so immediately
- Use the same terminology as the Excel workbook (F&B Minimum, Service Charge, Production Fee, etc.)
- The end users are non-technical — UI copy should be plain English, never developer jargon
- When in doubt about a pricing edge case, ask Gary rather than guessing

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types — everything is explicitly typed
- Types for all database tables in src/types/
- Use Zod for runtime validation of inputs

### React / Next.js
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when interactivity is needed
- Use `use server` actions for form submissions
- Keep components small and focused
- No prop drilling deeper than 2 levels — use context or composition

### Supabase
- All queries go through src/lib/supabase/ — no direct Supabase calls in components
- RLS policies on all tables
- Migrations in supabase/migrations/ with descriptive names
- Seed data in supabase/seed/ — includes all reference data from the Excel workbook

### Testing
- Vitest for unit tests
- Pricing engine has 100% test coverage — no exceptions
- Every calculation path must have a test with expected values from the Excel workbook
- Test fixtures should mirror real proposal data

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS only — no CSS modules, no styled-components
- Use consistent spacing scale
- Mobile-responsive but optimize for desktop/tablet (this is a data-entry app)

## Design Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 2026-04-03 | Build custom vs buy Curate | Curate doesn't support tri-rate taxes, 11 category markups, multi-scenario comparison, or internal margin analysis. Recent botched migration is a red flag. | Curate (~$100+/mo), Airtable + custom frontend, enhanced Excel |
| 2026-04-03 | Next.js + Supabase + Vercel | Gary's proven stack. Zero new technology risk. Supabase handles auth + RLS + admin-friendly table editor as backup. | Python/Django (slower frontend iteration), Rails (unfamiliar) |
| 2026-04-03 | Pricing engine as pure TypeScript | Must be testable independent of UI. Must produce identical results to Excel. Can't have framework dependencies polluting business logic. | Inline calculations in React components (untestable, fragile) |
| 2026-04-03 | Single EstimateSummary type for all estimate types | AV and Decor map into the same summary fields (equipment→taxable, qcStaffing→non-taxable). Keeps engine simple; ExportButtons uses estimateType prop to relabel fields for copy output. | Separate summary types per estimate type (more code, same data shape) |
| 2026-04-03 | Travel Expenses as full-width section below line items | Sidebar (288px) was too narrow for trip fields to be usable. Three trips render in 3-column grid at full width. Sidebar now contains only Summary + Margin Analysis. | Sidebar placement (rejected — unusable), separate travel page |
| 2026-04-03 | ComparisonView groups cards by type | Lowest/Best Margin badges should only compare within the same category (venue vs venue, AV vs AV). Cross-type comparison is meaningless. | Single flat grid with type badge on each card (rejected — misleading badges) |
| 2026-04-03 | UserMenu as thin client component receiving email as prop | Layout is a Server Component that already has the user. Passes email as prop to avoid a redundant client-side session fetch. | Client component fetching its own session (extra round trip) |

## Gotchas Log

| Date | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2026-04-03 | QC monogram PNG is dark — invisible on dark charcoal nav | Added `brightness-0 invert` Tailwind filter classes to the Image in both layouts. No separate white asset needed. |
| 2026-04-03 | Supabase password reset requires /reset-password in Redirect URLs allowlist | Must add the URL in Supabase dashboard → Auth → URL Configuration, otherwise the reset link is blocked. |

## Current TODOs

### Completed ✓
- [x] Scaffold Next.js project with App Router
- [x] Set up Supabase project and create migration files
- [x] Seed reference data from Excel workbook
- [x] Build pricing engine with tests (74 tests passing)
- [x] Build admin panel for reference data (locations, markups, tiers, travel tables)
- [x] Build estimate builder UI (Venue, AV, Decor builders)
- [x] Build export functionality (Copy Numbers, Export to Excel — all three estimate types)
- [x] Copy Numbers: grouped summary format (Menu/Bar Package/Staffing/Equipment/Venue Rental/Production Fee/Tax) with 18 unit tests
- [x] Travel expense calculator with per-trip breakdown feeding into True Net margin
- [x] File attachments per estimate (Supabase Storage) — PDF/PNG/JPG/JPEG, max 10MB, with upload/list/delete UI
- [x] Auth: login, signup (@qceventdesign.com restriction), forgot password, reset password
- [x] Nav: UserMenu with email + Sign Out, white monogram fix
- [x] ComparisonView: grouped by estimate type, per-type badges
- [x] ScenarioTabs: typed estimate creation (Venue/AV/Decor) inline, no page navigation needed

### Remaining
- [ ] Validate against 3-5 real historical proposals — compare engine output to Excel for same inputs
- [ ] PDF/Canva export — format for client-facing proposals
- [ ] Mobile polish — currently optimized for desktop/tablet only
- [ ] Role-based access — admin vs user distinction exists in DB but UI enforcement is minimal
